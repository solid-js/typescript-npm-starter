# Solid JS - Typescript NPM Starter

A quick start for NPM libraries with Typescript sources.


## Features

Type code in typescript and this will convert sources to commonjs / esnext / node compatible output.


## Requirements

##### Only for github open source projects
Non github projects will work but documentation will not be uploaded to github.io.

##### Only for public npm projects
Non public npm projects will work but when installing a new project, call `node setup no-publish` to avoid publishing your package in public scope.


## Install

1. Create a new project on github

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid-js/typescript-npm-starter/master/install.sh | sh`
