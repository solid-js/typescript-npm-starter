# Typescript NPM Starter

Smart starter for NPM libraries with Typescript sources, integrated unit testing, release scripts, and Markdown documentation.

## Requirements

- MacOS or Linux based system
- Node 8.7+ and NPM 6+
- Git 2.0+

_You can open an issue for Windows Support. Any help will be welcome._


## Technology Agnostic

Ready for any technology !
Try [Typescript NPM Starter](https://github.com/solid-js/typescript-npm-starter/) to create Typescript based NPM libraries.


## For Open-Source projects

#### Better with public GitHub repositories
#### Better with public NPM libraries

_Other Git repos and private NPM projects will work but documentation will not be uploaded to github.io._


## Clean documentation

Create [clean documentations](https://solid-js.github.io/classic-npm-starter/) thanks to [docsify](https://docsify.js.org).
Markdown editing with no compiling phase. Really simple management and automatically uploaded to your github.io space when pushing a new version.

## Publication process

Shipped with scripts to ease publication process :
- One command to publish work in progress to Git
- One command to release a new version to NPM
- Push new doc automatically to github.io when any doc file has changed
- Manage versions easily
